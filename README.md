# Your Opinion

---
Your Opinion is web application that is intended to allow the user an easier way to develop their own opinion. Instead of having their opinion swayed by the news outlet they mostly use, Your Opinion will display news from multiple outlets at once. Not only that, Your Opinion will divide the news outlets between left and right leaning companies. The information will be displayed simply in a left and right column. This will allow the user to clearly see how the information is being presented to them and allow them to form their own opinion.
